# Stupid Scripts
This is a roblox script thing that has really funny items for troll guis and stuff.

Heres the code to run it:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This only works with server scripts. Client scripts will most of the time break.

```
local HttpService = game:GetService("HttpService")
local Script = "Life-Simulator"
local Code = HttpService:GetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coolguyandstuffyeah/Stupid-Scripts/refs/heads/main/" .. Script, true)
local Player = "DISPLAY NAME HERE"
local Run = loadstring('local Plr = "' .. Player .. '"\n' .. Code)
Run()
```
